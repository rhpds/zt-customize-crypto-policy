== Modify the FUTURE crypto policy

The Chief Security Officer sends out the following e-mail -

Application and Infrastructure Administrators,

After my last e-mail recommending 3072 bit public keys, I have received few concerns that some applications would need additional time for migration.

To continue supporting these applications running on our platform, and to provide more time for these applications to upgrade, my recommendation is to disallow TLS (1.0, and 1.1), and not allow SHA-1 hash usage.

**NOTE** We should still allow 2048 bit ciphers usage for a certain period of time until all applications can be upgraded to use 3072 bit keys.

-CSO
----
In order to comply with the requirements set forth by the CSO above, you
will update the system to modify the existing *FUTURE* policy to support shorter
keys of 2048 bit length. By default, the minimum key length in the
*FUTURE* policy is set to 3072-bit.

You will now check the currently active crypto policy in effect on the
system -

[source,bash]
----
update-crypto-policies --show
----
[source,text]
----
rhel@rhel:~# update-crypto-policies --show
FUTURE
----

Restart Apache.

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
----
[source,text]
----
rhel@rhel:~# systemctl restart httpd.service
Job for httpd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status httpd.service" and "journalctl -xeu httpd.service" for details.
----

The Apache service has failed to start. You will now check the status of
the Apache service -

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status httpd.service --no-pager
----
[source,text]
----
[rhel@rhel ~]$ systemctl status httpd.service --no-pager

You can see a more specific error message in the SSL error log for
Apache.

[source,bash]

[rhel@rhel ~]$ sudo tail -2 /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log
[Wed Jun 18 14:43:55.916631 2025] [ssl:emerg] [pid 29307:tid 29307] AH02562: Failed to configure certificate rhel.lab.sandbox-x5n8h-ocp4-cluster.svc.cluster.local:443:0 (with chain), check /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
[Wed Jun 18 14:43:55.916650 2025] [ssl:emerg] [pid 29307:tid 29307] SSL Library Error: error:0A00018F:SSL routines::ee key too small
----

The error message indicates that the key length was too small which was
expected because the *FUTURE* policy requires a minimum of 3072-bit
keys.

Now, you will create a policy modifier module called *2048KEYS.pmod*
that can be used with the FUTURE crypto policy. Policy modifiers are
text files that include policy instructions to the
update-crypto-policies tool.

The naming of these files must follow the following convention :
*_MODULE_.pmod*, where *_MODULE_* is the name of the modifier in
uppercase without spaces, and .pmod is the file extension in lowercase.

Next, you will create a policy modifier called *2048KEYS.pmod* that will
set the minimum key size to 2048 bits. In the policy modifier file, you will specify the minimum key size of
both RSA and DH keys -

[source,bash]
----
echo "min_rsa_size = 2048" > 2048KEYS.pmod
----

[source,bash]
----
echo "min_dh_size = 2048" >> 2048KEYS.pmod
----

Copy the modifier file to the policy module directory
[source,bash]
----
sudo cp 2048KEYS.pmod /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/2048KEYS.pmod
----
You will now configure the system to use a modified *FUTURE* policy with
our newly created policy modifier -

[source,bash]
----
sudo update-crypto-policies --set FUTURE:2048KEYS
----
[source,text]
----
[rhel@rhel ~]$ sudo update-crypto-policies --set FUTURE:2048KEYS
Setting system policy to FUTURE:2048KEYS
Note: System-wide crypto policies are applied on application start-up.
It is recommended to restart the system for the change of policies
to fully take place.
----

If you want to apply multiple policy modifiers, you can chain together
several policy modifiers separated using '`:`'. The policy modifiers are
evaluated left to right to modify the specified named policy.

You can now verify that the new policy has been applied to the system.

[source,bash]
----
update-crypto-policies --show
----
[source,text]
----
[rhel@rhel ~]$ update-crypto-policies --show
FUTURE:2048KEYS
